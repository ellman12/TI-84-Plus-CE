# TI-84-Plus-CE
This repository is for holding all of my programs and other files for my TI-84 Plus CE Graphing Calculator. It's separated into three folders: old unused programs no longer in use, programs currently in use, and other miscellaneous files (matrices, etc.). Feel free to use as long as you have been granted permission by me.
